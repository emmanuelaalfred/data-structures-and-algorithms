# Asignment 2 - Using Priority Queues**

Given 07/02/2024

Write a menu-driven application that incorporates the source code that you studied in relation to Priority Queue & Heap data structures. 

Your task is to develop an application for use in the Accident & Emergency department at your local hospital. 

The program will accept an incoming patient’s name and an integer that indicates the seriousness of their condition.  

This integer is a value between 1 and 5 – 1 being a minor illness and 5 being a critical condition. 

The admissions nurse will input the details (name and priority rating) to the program (which should form a Patient object/variable). 

The program will add the incoming patient to the correct place on the list based on the priority rating of their condition. The order for patients on the list with the same priority rating will be in order of time of admission to the hospital. 

The program will display the Priority List for treatment of patients. When a doctor becomes available to treat a patient, the next patient’s name is removed from the priority queue and displayed on the screen.

So, the menu should offer the following:

1. Add a new patient
1. Call the next patient (Delete)
1. Print the current Queue of patients
1. Exit

Please have the following available for practical session on signoff date:

1. The working version of the above.
1. A verbal explanation of the program´s construction, if requested.
1. Deadline: February 21<sup>st</sup> in practical class
